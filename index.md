Hi! I am a MSc Applied Social Data Science student at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I completed my undergraduate studies in BSc Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at King's College London. I'm interested in applying machine learning and network analysis to study political identity, economic behaviour, and collective action.

I am currently looking for junior level positions in data science or research. Check out my updated [CV](assets/CV.pdf) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-f-5a87a919b/). If you would like to be in touch, you can contact me through [email](laurafung360@gmail.com). Do reach out if you have an opportunity to share.

Some projects I worked on, which you can also find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chief-mouser)
